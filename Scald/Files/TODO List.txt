This list has the purpose to keep together everything that has to be done or that could be studied in order
to make part of the framework Scald and improve it. There´s always the possibility of have things missing or
somebody else have a better idea regardless of it being listed here, if there´s an idea please contact the
administrator about it, please support this project by helping it improve, any suggestion is welcome.

Thanks from the administrator.


Things to be done:

- more tests with the framework, in order to find more bugs
- the real-time battle system
- the progressive turn battle system
- aply the texture to determined body parts, being it by passing the name or a value that indicates the body
part
- the menu system to make it possibe by using xml and also that every character can have a different menu,
so that they have only the options important to them or according to their abilities.
- more effects to the system, like playing video or shaders
- make the particle system to have differents use during battle and outside it
- some rules aren´t being used, like the random rule for battle and the change screen for battle
- change the xml used to describe the map, because the character can´t have always the same position, must use a
script to specify where he will appear according to the place he came from - aplies for both way of moving
- a script to create the begging of the game, tells which cutscene to execute
- the begging menu to indicate what must execute at each options, so that can call the begging script
- battle effects when an action happen


Bugs:

- not all models work properly with the graphics engine
- sometimes the character sink when walking
- the character sometimes sink when colliding
- the texture is lost when the menu is opened or an event happens



Ideas:

- can try to implement different type of worlds, like permit the use of 3D or 2D world for the game
- study other types of RPG systems, like for example the strategy type of RPG and make this type of RPG system possible,
some ideas are the RPGs Final Fantasy Tactics and Brigandine Legend of Forsena, two different types of strategy RPG





For now these are the things that I can remember, whenever I remember something else I will update this file.
